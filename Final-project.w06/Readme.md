# Final Project: Verse Ventures

### The program
The program is an interactive tool that enables users to explore famous Bible verses in a variety of versions.

### How it works
The program presents to users a randomly selected Bible verse from a curated list of 50 famous verses. Users are then given the option to view the verse in different versions. The verses are fetched from the [Bible Scripture API](https://api.scripture.api.bible/).
